initial_xa_calculator is a utility that takes as argument the name of the mesa network file (*.net), initial [Fe/H], and intial [alpha/Fe], as well as an optional dY/dZ. It creates as output an initial_xa file for use with MESA/star. The file can be used when either 

      set_uniform_initial_xa_from_file = .false.
      set_uniform_xa_from_file = .false.

are set to true in the star_job section of the MESA inlist. The initial_xa filename is, by default, input_initial_composition.data and so should be set in the same inlist as

      file_for_uniform_xa = 'input_initial_composition.data'

It is current with MESA modules as of the 9575 release (02/2017).

The program relies on several MESA modules. To compile the code requires that:

i) MESA is installed and
ii) the MESA_DIR environment variable is set. Otherwise you must set it explicitly in src/makefile.

To compile, simply execute the mk script, as 

./mk

Running the program without any commmand line arguments will generate the following output:

usage:
    ./initial_xa_calculator [net_name] [Fe/H] [alpha/Fe] {dY/dZ}
     net_name = mesa/net network 
     [Fe/H] = 0 for solar
     [alpha/Fe] = 0 for solar
     dY/dZ = 1.5 by default, OPTIONAL

initial_xa_calculator is basedon the Asplund et al. (2009) solar abundance scale.
